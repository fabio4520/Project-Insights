Insights is a local, global-oriented measurement and data analytics startup that
(in our opinion) provides (almost) the most complete and trusted view available
of consumers and markets.

For more than 30 days, Insights has provided data and analytics based on
scientific rigor and innovation (sort of), continually developing new ways to
answer the most important questions facing the media, advertising, retail and
fast-moving consumer goods industries. As an S&P 500 company wannabe, Insights
has operations in over 3 or 4 bedrooms with access to the whole world
information through the internet.

Our self-awarded team of analysts works untiringly to process and share insights
of all kinds of data collected (or generated) by committed volunteer(s).

Our research team has acquired a large dataset on the consumption of 500 people
in 100 restaurants around the world for a set of 50 specific dishes during the
year 2019.

The data has come on a raw [CSV file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FAwitP9JY9r9mynhme_U7hKxhA77df1c/view) with this form:

<aside> ðŸ’¡ On December 06, 2019, Jewel Daniel, a physicist Romanian man, 28
years old, visited "Fat Pizza", an "Italian" restaurant located in Haleyport
city (790 Corrine Prairie), and ordered a Lasagna which cost him $34.</aside>

As the developer/analyst team of Insights, your job is to transform this raw
data into a clean and manageable relational database and answer the deep
questions the research team have come up with.

---

## Tasks

### Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

At this point, it should be quite obvious that the current CSV file is not
normalized. It is just one single table with a lot of repeated data.

Take a moment with your team to analyze and normalize this table and prepare an
ERD which shows `tables`, `columns`, `columns_types`, `constrains`, and
`relationships`. You can use any software you want for this. Even pencil and
paper would be enough.

You should include an image of your ERD (png, jpg, pdf) on your solution.

### Create the database and tables

Using Data Definition Language (DDL) statements, create the database and tables
according to your Entity Relationship Diagram.

Put all your SQL code inside a file named `create.sql`. Check the order of your
commands! For example, you can't `REFERENCES clients(id)` if the table "clients"
doesn't exist yet.

If your `create.sql` file works well, you should be able to delete your entire
database and create it again doing something similar to:

```bash
$ dropdb insights
$ createdb insights
$ psql -d insights < create.sql
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
...
CREATE TABLE
$ 
```

Include the `create.sql` file on your solution.

### Populate your tables

The `data.csv` file has more than 85K records. Inserting that amount of data
manually is not an option. Create a ruby application to upload all the records
to your database.

The program should be called `insert_data.rb` and should take two arguments
`database_name` and `csv_file_path`.

Include the `insert_data.rb` file on your solution.

### CLI app to interact with the database

Now we have the database ready to start receiving queries. The research team has
required the development of a CLI app to share some insights about the
Restaurant consumption data with our users.

<aside> ðŸ’¡ All the example tables are using dummy data. Their numbers do not
represent the expected result, just the expected format.

</aside>

**Client can see a menu**

As a client, I want to run the application and see a menu with a list of options
so that I could choose the topic I am most interested in.

- When I run the commandÂ `ruby restaurant-insights.rb`Â I see a welcome message
- And below the welcome message, I see a list with 10 options
- And I'm prompted to choose one option with the message
  `Pick a number from the list and an [option] if necessary`
- And when I write 'menu' the Welcome message and menu are printed again.
- And when I write 'quit' the program ends.

```bash
$ ruby restaurant-insights.rb
Welcome to the Restaurants Insights!
Write 'menu' at any moment to print the menu again and 'quit' to exit.
